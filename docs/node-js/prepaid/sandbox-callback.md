# Sandbox Report and Callback

## Sandbox report

For prepaid services in development, because the transaction status will not change automatically, you must change it manually using our Sandbox Report on [our developer website](https://developer.iak.id/sandbox-report). 

You can see how to use this service by seeing [here](https://api.iak.id/docs/platform/docs/integration/sandbox-report.md#prepaid).

## Callback

For prepaid services in development, besides check the transaction status regularly, you can use our callback service. So, when the transaction status changes automatically in the production state or manually on the development state, you can receive the response that filled with the changed status and don't have to check the transaction status regularly.
