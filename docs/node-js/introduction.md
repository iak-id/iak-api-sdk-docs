# IAK API Node.js SDK

This is Node.js-based SDK (server-side-only) to easily help you connect your application with our API services.

**Note**:
* This library is only meant for usage from server-side.
* You also have to register yourself first on this [link](https://iak.id/) to get the access key for our API service.
* For Prepaid Services, you can use our **Version 2** Prepaid on Core API section on Prepaid services as the reference. To see the difference with the Version 1, you can see this [link](https://api.iak.id/docs/reference/docs/prepaid/core/v1-vs-v2.md).
